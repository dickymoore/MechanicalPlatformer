Please replace the placeholders with your required values.\n\nThe code first creates an S3 bucket where your HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other static files for your website are to be hosted. The bucket's ACL is set to 'public-read' to allow public access to the bucket. An IAM policy is also attached to the bucket to allow 'Get Object' action for all (\"*\") principals.\n\nThen it creates a CloudFront distribution, which improves the performance of delivering your website's content. It sets the default root object to 'index.html' which is often the file that serves as the home, or default, page for a website.\n\nThen, it outputs the S3 bucket's domain name and the CloudFront distribution's domain name, which you need to configure your DNS records.\n\nPlease note: While this code is a good start, you may need to modify it according to your specific requirements, security and compliance rules in your organization."
